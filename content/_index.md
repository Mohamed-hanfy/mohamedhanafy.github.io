 Hi, I'm Mohamed Hanafy, a Backend Engineer.


 I focus on building **scalable, secure, and high-performance systems**, with an emphasis on clean architecture and reliability.

 My primary expertise is in **Spring Boot**, supported by strong foundations in  **data structures**, **algorithms**, **operating systems**, 


 and **computer networking**. 



 I enjoy designing systems that are efficient, maintainable and production-ready.
